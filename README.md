**Stock Analysis with Python**

**About**   
This is a student project for the course "Programming: Introduction Level" - University of St. Gallen.   
The goal of this project was to create a program that analyzes different stocks during a given time frame.   
With this program you can enter various stocks and the time frame you want to analyze.    
As a result you will see the stocks with the most volume, highest return and highest daily volatility.    
In addition, the program visualizes each data in various graphs and gives you additional informations.   


**Prerequisites**   
For the program to work, you need to run it with Python3 (for example with PyCharm).   
The following libraries need to be installed in order for the code to work:   
Pandas, Datetime, Mathplotlib, Tkinder, Webbrowser, Random

**Instructions**
1. Start stock_analysis_py and run the program.
2. Input the stocks and the time frame you want to analyze. Make sure you enter the stocks with the right keys and the time frame in the given order.
   You can also click on "Set Random" to simulate the program with random stocks and a random time frame.
3. Click on the button "Analyse Stocks".    
   This will first open up a graph where you can see the stock with the highest return and also, if possible, their 20-days/100-days simple moving average.   
   It will also show you the stock with the most volume, the stock with the highest return and the stock with the highest daily volatility as outputs in the console.   
4. In additon you can visualize the stock prices, the returns and the volatility of each stock by clicking on the buttons in the "Stock Visualization" section.
   If you want to adjust or edit the graphs, you can find the buttons to do this in the top left corner of each graph.
5. If you want to have additional informations for each stock, you can simply click on the button "Stock Websites".   
   This will open the websites of each stock in yahoo finance where you will find more informations.   
   You can also click on "Yahoo Website" if you want to open the main yahoo finance website.
