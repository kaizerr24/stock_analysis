**Stock Analysis with Python**

**About**

This is a student project for the course "Programming: Introduction Level" - University of St. Gallen.   
The goal of this project was to create a program that analyzes different stocks during a certain time frame.   
With this programm you can enter various stocks and the time frame you want to analyze.    
As a result you will see the stocks with the most volume, highest return and highest daily volatility.    
In addition, the programm visualizes each data in various graphs.   


**Prerequisites**

For the program to work, you can run it with Python3.   
The following libraries need to be installed in order for the code to work:   
Pandas, Mathplotlib, Webbrowser, Random

**Instructions**
1. Start stock_analysis_py and run the program.
2. Input the stocks and the time frame you want to analyze. Make sure you enter the stocks with the right keys and the time frame in the given order.
   You can also click on "Set Random" to simulate the program with random stocks and a random time frame.
3. Click on the button "Analyse Stocks".    
   This will first open up a graph where you can see the stock with the highest return and also their 20-days/100-days simple moving average.   
   It will also show you the stock with the most volume, the stock with the highest return and the stock with the highest daily volatility as outputs in the console.   
4. In additon you can visualize the stock prices, the returns and the volatility of each stock by clicking on the buttons in the "Stock Visualization" category.
